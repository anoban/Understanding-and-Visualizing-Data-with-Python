## ___Memorandum___
-----------------

### ___Attributes to be evaluated___

- Number of toppings (discrete quantitative)
- Taste (categorical ordinal)
- Quality of the cheese used (categorical ordinal)
- Door delivery (categorical ordinal)
- Drive through service (categorical ordinal)
- Speed of service (categorical ordinal)
- Customer satisfaction (categorical ordinal)
- Quality of the dining place (categorical ordinal)
- Price (continuous quantitative)
- Speed of delivery (categorical ordinal)
- Types & sizes of pizza available. (categorical nominal)

### ___How to collect the data needed to evaluate the above mentioned criteria?___

- Make the pizza orders more detailed (include the types and numbers of toppings, types and sizes of pizza) and store every order details in a local/remote database.

- A small questionnaire at the end of dining (targetting people who choose to dine at the restaurent instead of those taking their orders home) asking the served customers to rate the taste, speed of service, satisfaction level, quality of the dining experience etc using a 5 star system. (Questionnaires are likely to annoy customers, so try to incentivize them by offering a discount if they fill up the questionnaire, if that's affordable)

- Inquire the chefs / kitchen staff about the quality of the cheese used (expensive, name brands, local products, cheap, low quality) -> star rating

- Check whether door delivery is available? If so, how far it extends? (like within 10 miles radius of the restaurant ..or so) -> use a star based rating system

- Check whether a drive-through is available? If so, how many lanes are there?, how many vehicles can be accomodated at once? how fast these ques move typically? -> use a rating system

- Reccurring customers per a defined timespan. Can be indicative of customer satisfaction. -> use the order database to query the recurring customers. And see whether the order size increases with consecutive visits? (if they find the pizza delicious and the dining experience pleasant, they might bring their family/friends over next time ... )

- Study how competitive are the prices offered by this company. Visit other pizza companies/restaurants (in masquerade perhaps) and study their menus or leverage their websites to scrape this type of data.

- Use the above technique to study what types and sizes of pizzas are offered by competitors.

- Disguised visits or deliberate orders (if legal??) can be used to examine the number of toppings, taste, quality of the cheese, door delivery, drive through service, speed of service, customer satisfaction, quality of the dining place, speed of delivery in competing restaurants, since these parameters are difficult to evaluate in settings outside your own company.

### ___Research questions___

- Does the availability of more types toppings boost sales? (Compare the sales frequencies of pizzas with the number of toppings)

- Does the pizza made here tastes "better" (subjective) than those sold by competitiors? (use the data gathered from the questionnaire)

- Does this company use a cheese that's on par with or better than the ones used by competitors?.

- Does the availability or better quality door delivery, drive through increase sales? (May be difficult to compare with other companies since access to their sales data is less likely, but if this company has branches w/o drive-throughs or that do not provide door deliveries, we can compare with them)
